Colab is a web-based interactive python computing environment, or \u201cnotebook\u201d, offered free of charge by Google.

Note: This will take you to a ColabFold (Mirdita, M. et al. ColabFold: making protein folding accessible to all. Nat. Methods 19, 679\u2013682 (2022)) -Follow the instructions at the bottom of the ColabFold page. In brief, paste your FASTA sequence into the \u201cquery_sequence\u201d field, click on the \u201cRuntime\u201d dropdown at the top of the page, and select \u201cRun all\u201d. Note: This may take some time but your result.zip file should automatically download. If it does not, click on the folder icon on the left of the page, highlight the result.zip file, click on the 3 dots to the right, and select \u201cDownload\u201d. Retrieve your pdb file from the zip and return to https://potoyangroup.github.io/Seq2Ensemble/.</p> <p>Generate a conformational ensemble -Click on the \u201cOpen in Colab\u201d link below \u201cFrom structure to conformational ensemble\u201c. -Familiarize yourself with the notebook: You should see a page that looks like the figure below. If it doesn\u2019t, the small arrows left of the cells will display more information. On the left, there is a folder icon. All of the files generated in or uploaded to the notebook can be found here or within one of the subfolders. If for some reason the session fails, you may need to \u201cRestart runtime\u201d under the \u201cRuntime\u201d menu or \u201cDisconnect and delete runtime\u201d before restarting.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Start your session by clicking the \u201cplay\u201d button under \u201cRun this cell to set everything up\u201d Note: It may take 3 to 7 minutes for the python libraries, the OpenAwsem CG simulation software, and its dependencies to download and install. When cells are running a revolving animation will show around the \u201cstop\u201d button. When it finishes, the \u201cplay\u201d button will return, typically with a green checkmark next to it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the \u201cplay\u201d button underneath \u201cUpload a PDB file\u201d. -Click the \u201cChoose Files\u201d button and select your PDB file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Input the parameters under \u201cRun Molecular Dynamics with the AWSEM Coarse-Grained Force-Field for Proteins\u201d Enter the desired temperature in Kelvin and the desired number of steps. Structures are saved every 2000 steps. -Click on the Play icon to start the cgMD run Note: The initialization will take a few minutes but shortly you will see the timesteps quickly advance. Tens of thousands of timesteps can run in a matter of minutes. cgMD simulations produce uncorrelated conformations much faster than all-atom simulations and it is up to you, the complexity of your system, and the amount of colab \u201ccompute units\u201d you have available to decide on how long the simulation needs to run. The frame below the cell will grow until a scroll bar appears. If you need to navigate up or down the page, make sure you are using the other scroll bar, farthest to the right.</p> </li> <li> <p>After the simulation is complete, click the \u201cplay\u201d button beneath \u201cInstall Analysis Tools\u201d. Note: This step is necessary to run the subsequent cells.</p> </li> <li> <p>Choose the number of clusters or n member ensembles to generate and click \u201cplay\u201d. This step will cluster your trajectory according to the backbone r.m.s.d. with respect to the average structure. Conformations with similar r.m.s.d. will fall into the same cluster. From each cluster, a single \u201ccentroid\u201d that exhibits the mean r.m.s.d. of the cluster will be extracted as the representative structure. If you set n_clusters to 10, you will end up with 10 ensembles. Cluster 1 will be a 1-member ensemble, cluster 5 will be a 5-member ensemble, and so on. Note that each subsequent clustering iteration will take longer, so if you have a long trajectory and choose to generate 20 clusters, it may take a long time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Under \u201cLeast Squares Fitting of RDCs to Ensembles\u201d, click \u201cplay\u201d, \u201cChoose File\u201d and upload your RDC file. File format: At the moment, your RDC file should contain only two tab separated columns. The first column should be the residue ID and the second column should be RDC values. The residue IDs must match the residues in your PDB file and your PDB should be indexed from 1. For instance, if the canonical residue IDs start with residue 5 in your structure file, you will need to subtract all the residue IDs in your RDC file by 4. The least squares fitting will iterate through all the ensembles generated in the previous clustering step. This step can be very time consuming with a large number of n_clusters. After all the fittings have been completed, plots of the back-calculated ensemble RDCs vs experimental RDCs will display with their corresponding R factors describing the goodness of the fits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the \u201cplay\u201d button under \u201cZip and Download the Results\u201d Before archiving the results, amino acid sidechains will be modeled onto the coarse grained backbone structures composing your ensembles. After this, a \u201cseq_to_ensemble_output.zip\u201d file should automatically download. This file contains: (i) Folders \u201call_atom_cluster_1\u201d to n with the ensemble structures in pdb format, and (ii) Folder rdc_fitting_results with the files \u201censemble_rdcs.csv\u201d (calculated vs experimental RDCs), \u201censemble_R_values.csv\u201d (list of R-factors), and a \u201cpar\u201d folder (the alignment tensor parameters per each ensemble member).</p> </li> </ul> <p>NOTE: You also have the option to energy minimize the side chains of the structures composing an ensemble. Press \u201cplay\u201d under \u201cWhat are the best ensembles?\u201d and you will be shown the ensemble ids and corresponding R values in order of the best fits (lower R is better).</p> <p>Under \u201cEnergy Minimize an Ensemble\u201d, enter the id of the fit whose structures you\u2019re interested in analyzing more closely. A backbone restrained energy minimization in implicit solvent will be performed and each of the minimized structures will be saved to a new folder, archived, and downloaded as \u201cminimized_cluster_x.zip\u201d. If you compare these to the \u201call_atom_cluster_x\u201d structures, you will notice some of the side chains have moved.</p> <p>Potential Issues The Runtime menu at the top has an option to \u201cchange runtime type\u201d. This should automatically be set to \u201cGPU\u201d, but if your simulation is running slowly, it might be set to \u201cCPU\u201d and should be changed.</p> <p>cgMD simulation temperature may not correspond exactly to physical temperatures. If you do not obtain a nice fitting ensemble, you may need to adjust your run temperature by 10-20K or run your simulation longer. If you run into errors that can\u2019t be resolved by restarting the notebook, please post them to the issues page at https://github.com/PotoyanGroup/Seq2Ensemble/issues</p>"}]}
